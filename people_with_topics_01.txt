    "name": "Gary Klein",
    "description": "Gary Klein is a research psychologist famous for pioneering in the field of naturalistic decision making. By studying experts such as firefighters in their natural environment, he discovered that laboratory models of decision making could not describe  it under uncertainty. His recognition primed decision (RPD) model has influenced changes in the ways the Marines and Army train their officers to make decisions Klein received his B.A. in Psychology from City College of New York (1964) and his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Pittsburgh (1969).  He listed his main influences as Hubert Dreyfus, Adriaan de Groot, and Karl Duncker in an October 2013 interview with Bob Morris. Since 2009, Klein has been a Senior Scientist at MacroCognition LLC.He spent the first phase of his career in academia as an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Oakland University (1970–1974).  He also spent a few years as Associate Professor of Psychology at Wilberforce University in Ohio.\nThe second phase was spent working for the government as a research psychologist for the U.S. Air Force (1974–1978). The Arab oil embargo of 1973 meant that pilots needed to do more of their training in simulators, and Klein began his investigations into the way people develop expertise.\nThe third phase began in 1978 when he founded his own R&D company, Klein Associates, to study a range of topics that are now described as the Naturalistic Decision Making framework. Klein Associates grew to 37 people by the time he sold it to Applied Research Associates (ARA) in 2005.\nDuring this third phase, Dr. Klein developed a Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) model in 1985 to describe how people actually make decisions in natural settings. This research was subsequently incorporated in Army doctrine for command and control.  He presented a PreMortem method of risk assessment in 1998.   In 2007, he developed a naturalistic model of sensemaking, the Data/Frame model. In 2009, he presented a Management by Discovery account of how people plan when faced with ill-defined goals.  He described a multi-path model of insight in 2011.  He has led teams that developed several methods of cognitive task analysis for uncovering the tacit knowledge that goes into decision making and for studying cognition in complex settings, including the Critical Decision Method and the Knowledge Audit.  He was one of the leaders of a team that redesigned the White House Situation Room. In 2015, Gary founded ShadowBox LLC, a cognitive skills training company. The ShadowBox Training Method originated from a Master's thesis in 2008, conducted by now-retired fire battalion chief, Neil Hintze. Gary and Neil worked together to refine this method for training cognitive skill development. The goal of the ShadowBox method is to provide a flexible, scenario-based training technique, that allows trainees to see the world through the eyes of experts — without the experts having to be present. Klein and others report that ShadowBox training has been employed in the military, law enforcement, healthcare, social services, and petrochemical domains.He is a Fellow of both the American Psychological Association and the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. In 2008, he received the Jack A. Kraft Innovator Award from the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",

Reply All is an award-winning podcast about some of the internet’s most fascinating stories with unexpected twists.\nEarly on, PJ Vogt interned at This American Life, working alongside future Gimlet-founder Alex Blumberg. He so wanted the position, he actually lied on his application that he had already graduated college. In a lucky twist of fate, he landed the position and then dropped out of his senior year. After his internship, Vogt obtained a position as a contributor for WNYC’s On the Media, where he worked for five years. He and Alex Goldman piloted WNYC Studio’s TLDR (Too Long, Didn’t Read), a short podcast that featured stories about the unpredictable and even darker sides of the internet.\nIn 2014, PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman left their stable positions at WNYC to join Blumberg’s newly founded Gimlet Media. Vogt and Goldman began co-hosting Gimlet Media’s second podcast, Reply All, through which they continued their journey through internet’s maze of “fun house” mirrors and longterm consequences. Vogt continues to work with Blumberg, who guest stars on recurring “Yes, Yes, No” internet trivia episodes. In addition, two episodes of Reply All have been featured on This American Life.\nReply All is acclaimed by critics and received multiple awards. It was nominated twice (2015, 2016) for Shorty Awards for its dedicated social media presence such as a 48 hour marathon in which fans could call in ask ask the hosts anything they wanted. In 2016, Reply All was nominated for the Webby Award for Best Podcast and the Mixcloud Online Radio Awards for Best Online Talk Show in education. By 2017, The Independent featured Reply All in their “Twenty Podcasts that Will Make You Smarter.”\nIn 2017, PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman shared the behind the scenes process of creating Reply All on Talks at Google. More recently, they delved into their co-hosting relationship on Live at Code 2019. In an interview with Brooklyn Magazine, Vogt shared the story of his career and what lead him to take a chance at Gimlet Media and Reply All. He has also been featured on NPR’s All Things Considered. Vogt has appeared many podcast episodes, including Gimlet Media’s first podcast, StartUp, and The Moment with Brian Koppelman. In order to avoid spamming unsuspecting social media users, Vogt hosts a separate instagram account dedicated to his poodle, Ralphie.",
